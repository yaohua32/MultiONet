# MultiONet
Introduction to the MultiONet method for Parametric PDEs. MultiONet is an extension of the DeepONet method which was first introduced in the paper: [DGenNO: a novel physics-aware neural operator for solving forward and inverse PDE problems based on deep, generative probabilistic modeling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999125004206).
